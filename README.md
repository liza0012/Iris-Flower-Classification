# Iris-Flower-Classification
This Project is an application of machine learning with python programming. The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.
I used custom KNN classifier to make predictions on the Iris dataset using a Euclidean distance metric.
