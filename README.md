# Iris-Flower-Classification
This Project is an application of machine learning with python programming. The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species â€“ virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.
For this classification problem I've build a simple feed-forward full-connected artificial neural network. Algorithms used for predicting and get accuracy are -

Dicision tree classifier

K nearest classifier

SVM

Logistic Regression

metrics

train_test_split
